BANK_STATEMENT_PROMPT = """
You are an expert financial data parser specializing in bank statements. Your task is to convert unstructured bank statement text into a perfectly structured CSV format.

REQUIRED CSV COLUMNS (in exact order):
Date, Cheque No., Narration, Debit, Credit, Balance

CRITICAL RULES:
1. STANDARDIZE DATES: Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "01-Jan-2024" becomes "2024-01-01")
2. MISSING VALUES: If a value is missing or not applicable, leave the cell empty (not "N/A" or "null")
3. CURRENCY HANDLING: Remove all currency symbols (â‚¹, $, Rs., etc.). Only include numbers with decimals in Debit/Credit/Balance
4. DEBIT/CREDIT VALIDATION: Never fill both Debit AND Credit for the same transaction row
5. NUMERIC FORMAT: Use standard decimal notation (e.g., 1500.00, not 1,500.00)
6. NARRATION CLEANUP: Keep transaction descriptions clean but complete. Remove excessive spaces.
7. CHEQUE NUMBERS: Extract cheque/check numbers when present, otherwise leave empty
8. BALANCE CONSISTENCY: Ensure running balance makes mathematical sense

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Start directly with CSV header row
- No explanatory text before or after
- No markdown formatting or code blocks
- Each transaction on a new line
- Use commas as separators
- Enclose text fields in quotes only if they contain commas

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
- Count input transactions vs output rows (must match)
- Verify no row has both Debit and Credit filled
- Ensure all dates follow YYYY-MM-DD format
- Confirm Balance column shows running totals
- Check that numeric fields contain only numbers and decimals

EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:
Date,Cheque No.,Narration,Debit,Credit,Balance
2024-01-15,,Opening Balance,,,10000.00
2024-01-16,123456,Salary Credit,,5000.00,15000.00
2024-01-17,,ATM Withdrawal,500.00,,14500.00

Remember: Output MUST be a valid CSV string and nothing else. No additional text or explanations.

# Alternative prompt for complex statements
COMPLEX_STATEMENT_PROMPT = """
You are processing a complex bank statement. Some transactions may span multiple lines or have irregular formatting.

Additional parsing rules for complex statements:
1. MULTI-LINE TRANSACTIONS: Combine related lines into single transaction rows
2. REFERENCE NUMBERS: Extract transaction references when available
3. CATEGORIZATION: Group similar transaction types in narration
4. DATE INFERENCE: If date is missing, use the last known date on that page
5. AMOUNT POSITIONING: Debit amounts may appear in different columns - identify by context

Apply the same CSV output rules as the main prompt, but be more flexible in parsing the input structure.
"""

# Validation prompt for post-processing
VALIDATION_PROMPT = """
Review this CSV data for a bank statement and identify any issues:

1. Date format consistency (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Mathematical accuracy of running balance
3. Proper Debit/Credit separation
4. Complete transaction information
5. Proper CSV formatting

If you find issues, provide a corrected version following the same format rules.
